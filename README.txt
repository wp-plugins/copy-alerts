Copy Alerts notifies you when someone copies your content

== Description ==

If you are concerned about others copying your content or just want to know where your content is being distributed, this plugin will make it easy to add a Copy Alert for any post or page. Once a Copy Alert is added, you will be notified when copies of your content are found. You will be provided a detailed report that highlights the copied content in a side by side comparison view.

== Installation == 

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it
2. Upload the copy-alerts folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory
3. Go to the plugins page and click 'Activate' for Copy Alerts
4. Enter a notification email where all Copy Alerts should be sent

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

You must confirm each Copy Alert added via a confirmation email. It's easy, just click the confirm link when you receive it. This is to prevent others from maliciously signing you up for alerts you don't want.

== Screenshots ==

1. Create a new Copy Alert
